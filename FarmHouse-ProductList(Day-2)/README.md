## Product List – Responsive Grid Layout

This project is a responsive Product List page developed using HTML and CSS.

The layout is built using CSS Grid and displays multiple product cards such as headphones, smart watch, camera, shoes, laptop, speaker, smartphone, and backpack. Each product card includes an image, product name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button.

**##📱 Mobile View – iPhone 14 Pro Max(Responsive Page)**

### Responsive Design
- On desktop screens, products are displayed in multiple columns.
- On tablets, the layout adjusts to show fewer columns.
- On mobile devices, products are displayed in a single column for better readability.

The responsiveness is achieved using CSS Grid and media queries, and the layout adapts smoothly across different screen sizes, as demonstrated using browser developer tools.
